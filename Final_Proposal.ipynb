    "Our research question examines the correlation between changes in monetary policy and market performance. We have chosen to inspect this throuhg the lense of changes in the Reserver Requirement by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and returns from the S&P 500, **LONG TERM BOND PORTFOLIO**, and **SHORT TERM BOND PORTFOLIO**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our inquiry aims to shed light on whether an increase/decrease in the reserve requirement rate or the the magnitude of that change, is linked to positive or negative returns in the stock market, long-term bond market, or short-term bond market. \n",
    "\n",
    "The FOMC's decisions on whether to raise or lower interest rates have far-reaching effects on the economy. We aim to provide a framework that allows investors to time their investments more effectively around the FOMC's scheduled meetings. We believe that our findings will be of particular interest to institutional investors who seek to enhance their capital gains while minimizing losses through making thousands of trades with small gains that alltogether compound into a substainial profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, by examining the impact of FOMC's offical announcements on the performance of different indexes, investing in stocks or bonds immediately surrounding the press release of a FOMC meeting could be a potentially reliable method for institutional investors to increase their capital gains and minimize losses. We strongly believe that the insights gained from the project will provide a deeper understanding of the correlation between the reserve requirement rate and market returns.\n"

    "Our hypothesis is that there is a significant correlation between the reserve requirement rate and stock returns. Specifically, we anticipate that an increase in the reserve requirement rate will have a negative impact on stock returns, while a decrease in the reserve requirement rate will have a positive impact on stock returns. Additionally, we hypothesize that the magnitude of the change in the reserve requirement rate will be positively correlated with the magnitude of the change in stock returns. \n",

    "We predict that our research will provide evidence supporting the idea that investors can time their investments more effectively around the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) scheduled meetings. Specifically, we expect that investing in stocks surrounding the press release of the FOMC meeting will yield higher capital gains and lower losses than investing outside of that time frame. "
